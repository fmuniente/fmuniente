<h1 align="center">Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Fede</h1>

<br>

<h3 align="left">I'm a MERN Full Stack Web Developer</h3>

- ðŸ”­ Currently working as a R&D Software engineer in HP Printing and Computing Solutions S.L.U. 
Previously I was at [IronHack Barcelona](https://www.ironhack.com/en/barcelona) as a Teacher Assistant for the full time Web Development bootcamps.
  
- :star2: My main stack includes **TypeScript**, **React** (v18) and **Vue** (using Vue 2 on most projects, have not migrated everything to Vue 3 yet) for front-end development, with **SASS** in modules for styling (sprinkling some CSS-in-JS or TailwindCSS here and there). 

- :mailbox_closed: For back-end development I usually use combinations of **NodeJS** and **Express** or **Fastify**. I'm not specially picky between **Postgres**, **MySQL** or **MongoDB** (it depends on the project and specially on the ORM to work with them). Most of the time it's REST api services, but can also manage some GraphQL apis. 
  
- :rocket: Not shy to try any frameworks or test any new toy on side-projects on my free time. I like playing around with **Remix.js** and **Nuxt**, and have started enjoying **SvelteKit** lately.

- :cyclone: Not afraid to containerize everything, normally any project I start on has a template of docker services to spin everything up quickly with a `compose up` touch. Normally those include the database layer, and some observality tools like combinations of Prometheus and Grafana. As a bonus, I also have some basic knowledge of major AWS systems (S3, Lamba, Cloudfront, Cloudwatch).
  
- :hear_no_evil: With a closer look at [my career](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fede-muniente/) you will find a background as a Journalist and Content Manager, so I like to think that I am fluent in both the *content* and *container* parts of development.
    
- :see_no_evil: By the way, despite being quite verbose in my presentation, I like to keep my code lean and clean!
